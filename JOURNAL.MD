Entry #1.1
8:23pm-11:21pm
imported necessary libraries (kailh, raspi pico), set up footprints for encoder specifically bc kicad didnt link the encoder symbol with its footprint? 
first draft of switch layout! linked the kailh socket with a random switch symbol but i have the footprint so its gwaenchana!
