imported necessary libraries (kailh, raspi pico), set up footprints for encoder specifically bc kicad didnt link the encoder symbol with its footprint? <br>
first draft of switch layout! linked the kailh socket with a random switch symbol but i have the footprint so its gwaenchana!<br>
schematic rn:[alt text](journalPics/schematic1.png) 

i was. talking to someone. i think my rasppi symbol might be wrong. #fried. will look into it later LMFAOO<br>

# Entry #12
fixed the gaps between keys/rows in onshape + kicad. started on the plate. threw all the keycaps on the switches too. ss is without the caps bc thats how i was making the plate and im too lazy to unhide them. my computer is about to explode ðŸ’€

# 6/17/25
rewired pcb so my raspi can be like. .2 a mm closer to the keys ðŸ’€ (actually bc of the key rotation)
